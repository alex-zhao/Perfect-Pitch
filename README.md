# Perfect-Pitch
Sharpen your hearing with this fun and innovative Android game!

This was an Android app/game I made with my partner Blair for the HSHacks hackathon in February. I contributed all code, while Blair handled the business and presentation aspects. The basic premise of the game is to guess the frequency of a pitch; each round for 5 rounds, a pitch is played at a random frequency, and the player has to guess the frequency in Hertz. While creating this game, we learned how to create an Android app for the first time. Since this app was based around sound and generating sounds, we also had to study sound waves, frequencies, and pulse-code modulation in order for the app to work.
